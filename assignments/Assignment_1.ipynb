    "#  Learning Objectives\n",
    "The purpose of this assignment is to provide a refresher on fundamental concepts that we will use throughout this course and provide an opportunity to develop skills in any of the related skills that may be unfamiliar to you. Through the course of completing this assignment, you will... \n",
    "- Refresh you knowledge of probability theory including properties of random variables, probability density functions,  cumulative distribution functions, and key statistics such as mean and variance.\n",
    "- Revisit common linear algebra and matrix operations and concepts such as matrix multiplication, inner and outer products, inverses, the Hadamard (element-wise) product, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, orthogonality, and symmetry.\n",
    "- Practice numerical programming, core to machine learning, by loading and filtering data, plotting data, vectorizing operations, profiling code speed, and debugging and optimizing performance. You will also practice computing probabilities based on simulation.\n",
    "- Develop or refresh your knowledge of Git version control, which will be a core tool used in the final project of this course\n",
    "- Apply your skills altogether through an exploratory data analysis to practice data cleaning, data manipulation, interpretation, and communication \n",
    "\n",
    "We will build on these concepts throughout the course, so use this assignment as a catalyst to deepen your knowledge and seek help with anything unfamiliar.\n",

Also, the series of linear algebra videos by Grant Sanderson of 3Brown1Blue are excellent and can be viewed on youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab).

    "3. Show that the eigenvectors are orthogonal to one another (e.g. their inner product is zero). This is true for eigenvectors from real, symmetric matrices. In three dimensions or less, this means that the eigenvectors are perpendicular to each other. Typically we use the orthogonal basis of our standard x, y, and z, Cartesian coordinates, which allows us, if we combine them linearly, to represent any point in a 3D space. But any three orthogonal vectors can do the same. We will see this property is used in PCA to identify the dimensions of greatest variation in our data when we discuss dimensionality reduction."

    "**[6 points]** *Vectorization*. When we first learn to code and think about iterating over an array, we often use loops. If implemented correctly, that does the trick. In machine learning, we iterate over so much data that those loops can lead to significant slow downs if they are not computationally efficient. In Python, vectorizing code and relying on matrix operations with efficient tools like numpy is typically the faster approach. Of course, numpy relies on loops to complete the computation, but this is at a lower level of programming (typically in C), and therefore is much more efficient. This exercise will explore the benefits of vectorization. Since many machine learning techniques rely on matrix operations, it's helpful to begin thinking about implementing algorithms using vector forms.\n",
